# Getting Started

This area of the knowledge base will detail how you can login to the platform, invite colleagues, get your website tagged and configured, and track default metrics.

With these steps completed, you'll be ready to build your first experiment.

## Creating an account

If you don't already have an account, you can create one easily. We offer a free trial, which you can request [here](https://www.webtrends-optimize.com/saas-free-trial/){target=_blank}. This typically takes 5 minutes to create.

Full details can be found at [Creating an account](/getting-started/creating-an-account/).
