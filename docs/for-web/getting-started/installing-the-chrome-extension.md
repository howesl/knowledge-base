# Installing the Chrome Extension

The Visual Editor relies on a Chrome Extension to be able to load web pages. 

!!! info "Do you need the Visual Editor?"

    The Visual Editor is the only part of the platform that requires this Chrome Extension - no other section or feature is dependent on this. If you only use the Advanced Editor or only view Reports, you do not need this.

Many pages try to break out of iframes, do not have cookies in the right format, etc. - The Chrome Extension solves these issues, allowing you to seamlessly pull web pages into our Editor to build your experiences.

You can find the extension at the below link - please install it before using the Visual Editor.
