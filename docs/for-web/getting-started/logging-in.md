# Logging in

!!! question "Don't have an account yet?"
    
    You can create an account using the instructions provided [here](/getting-started/creating-an-account).

You'll be able to access the Optimize UI at [https://app.webtrends-optimize.com](https://app.webtrends-optimize.com).

We recommend using Chrome where possible, or browsers which can run Chrome Extensions such as Opera.

## Logging in with Optimize authentication
Once you've been given your access, the email will contain a link to login for the first time.

![New Account Email](/assets/new-account-invite.png)

When you follow the link, you'll be asked to create a password. Once set, you can use our default authentication to login for subsequent sessions.

If you only have access to one account, you'll land straight in the dashboard. If you have access to multiple accounts, you'll be asked to select an account before continuing.

## Logging in with Microsoft Single-Sign On (SSO)

!!! info "Enable Microsoft SSO on your account"

    The Webtrends Optimize support team will need to enable this for your user, and for any of your colleagues who you wish to authenticate with Microsoft SSO. This typically takes 24-48 hours.
    
    You will first need to perform steps listed at [Using Microsoft SSO](/getting-started/user-management/single-sign-on/microsoft-sso).

    And then contact the Support Team for enablement at [Contact Support](mailto:support@webtrends-optimize.com){target=_blank}
    
Logging in using Microsoft SSO allows you to manage access to the Webtrends Optimize platform at an organisation level.

Enabling Microsoft SSO is fairly easy, and once done users will authenticate there instead of through the Optimize authentication.

Removing users behaves in the same way, with you managing access for this.

For complete details of how this works, see: [Using Microsoft SSO](/getting-started/user-management/single-sign-on/microsoft-sso).

## Troubleshooting login

### Invalid password

If your password is invalid, try using Forgot Password. 

If we find an account for you, we'll email you a new link. This will allow you to land straight in the UI, and set a new password - similar to when you were first invited into the platform.

If your user has been deleted entirely, you will not receieve an email and should contact your admin / manager to get access back for the platform, or Contact Support using the links below
